# Sentimental-Analyss-on-Hotel-Reviews-Using-Logistic-Regression

This project focused on performing sentiment analysis on hotel reviews, beginning with data cleaning using Python and employing NLP techniques such as stop word removal, tokenization, and lemmatization for text preprocessing. The cleaned text data was then transformed into numerical vectors using the TF-IDF vectorizer, which were subsequently used to train an optimized Logistic Regression model achieved through Grid Search Cross-Validation. The model demonstrated strong performance, with a notably low misclassification rate for positive reviews, where only 139 were incorrectly classified as negative and 338 as neutral, while misclassifications for other sentiments remained below 50 instances.
